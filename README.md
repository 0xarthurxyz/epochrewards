On Celo, an "epoch" is a period of time during which a set of validators are elected to produce 
blocks. Every epoch is exactly 17,280 blocks or ~1 day long since a block is produced every 
5 seconds and there are 86,400 seconds in a day:

$5 \text{ seconds per block} \times 17280 \text{ blocks per epoch} = 86400 \text{ seconds per epoch } (= 1 \text{ day})$
